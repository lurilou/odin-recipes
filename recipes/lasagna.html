                <li>        fresh herbs (rosemary, basil, thyme) or dried italian herbs, salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
    

        <p class="i">For the Bechamel</p>
            <ul>
                <li>50g of butter</li>
                <li>100g flour</li>
                <li>1l milk</li>
                <li>salt, pepper</li>
                <li>parmesan</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="i">Other ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>pasta sheets</li>
                <li>mozzarella</li>
                <li>grated cheese</li>
                <li>breadcrumbs</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="hl sm">Method</p>
    <p class="i">To make the Bolognese</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To start making the Bolognese heat up some olive oil in a pan. Sautee the onions until translucent.  </li>
        <li>Add the mince and let brown.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the vegetables and let brown.</li>
        <li>Add in the garlic, chili and tomato puree.</li>
        <li>When starting to brown add a splash of wine to deglase.</li>
        <li>Season and add passata and chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Let simmer until ready to assemble the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="center">Now might be a good time to start preheating your oven to 200Â°C</p>

    <p class="i">To make the Bechamel</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pan</li>
        <li>Whisk in the flour and let cook out for a moment.</li>
        <li>Slowly start adding the milk while constantly stirring. The sauce will thicken up.</li>
        <li>Add however much parmesan you like and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="i">Assembly</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a little bit of Bolognese to the bottom of the oven dish.</li>
        <li>Add one layer of your pasta. Keep filling up the dish, alternating the sauces and pasta to your liking. I like to do Bolognese, pasta, Bechamel, pasta etc. Make sure to end it with a layer of Bechamel on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with cheese and some breadcrumbs to make it extra crispy.</li>
        <li>Let bake for about 35-40mins until nice and golden brown on top.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="i">Bonus tip:I like to add some frozen peas to one of my Bechamel layers. Just sprinkle them on before you put on the pasta.</p>
    <p>Now all that's left is to grab your favourite people and enjoy! Of coursem I also fully condone you eating it all  by yourself ;)</p>
