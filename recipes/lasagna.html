    <p>This gorgeous lasagna truly is a classic. With its perfectly constructed layers of alternating Bolognese, Bechamel and pasta nobody can resist it. Make it for your next family gathering, to impress your date or for your little birthday gathering. With my special little tricks learned from my family in Italy this dish is sure to be a showstopper!</p>

    <p><strong>Here's what you will need:</strong></p>  
    <p><em>For the Bolognese</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1       packet of vegan mince or organic beef mince</li>
        <li>1       big onion, chopped</li>
        <li>a few   heads of garlic, minced (I like to use 4-5 but adjust this according to your taste</li>
        <li>1 Chili</li>
        <li>1       big carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 - 2   stick of celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1       small pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2     courgette, chopped</li>
        <li>tomato puree</li>
        <li>1       jar passata</li>
        <li>1       tin tomatoes</li>
        <li>splash of wine</li>
        <li>        fresh herbs (rosemary, basil, thyme) or dried italian herbs, salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>For the Bechamel</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>50g of butter</li>
        <li>100g flour</li>
        <li>1l milk</li>
        <li>salt, pepper</li>
        <li>parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Other ingredients:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>pasta sheets</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
        <li>grated cheese</li>
        <li>breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Method</strong></p>
    <p><em>To make the Bolognese</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>To start making the Bolognese heat up some olive oil in a pan. Sautee the onions until translucent.  </li>
        <li>Add the mince and let brown.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the vegetables and let brown.</li>
        <li>Add in the garlic, chili and tomato puree.</li>
        <li>When starting to brown add a splash of wine to deglase.</li>
        <li>Season and add passata and chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Let simmer until ready to assemble the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now might be a good time to start preheating your oven to 200Â°C</p>

    <p><em>To make the Bechamel</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pan</li>
        <li>Whisk in the flour and let cook out for a mmoment.</li>
        <li>Slowly start adding the milk while constantly stirring. The sauce will thicken up.</li>
        <li>Add however much parmesan you like and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Assembly</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a little bit of Bolognese to the bottom of the oven dish.</li>
        <li>Add one layer of your pasta. Keep filling up the dish, alternating the sauces and pasta to your liking. I like to do Bolognese, pasta, Bechamel, pasta etc. Make sure to end it with a layer of Bechamel on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with cheese and some breadcrumbs to make it extra crispy.</li>
        <li>Let bake for about 35-40mins until nice and golden brown on top.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Bonus tip:</em> I like to add some frozen peas to one of my Bechamel layers. Just sprinkle them on before you put on the pasta.</p>
    <p>Now all that's left is to grab your favourite people and enjoy! Of coursem I also fully condone you eating it all  by yourself ;)</p>
